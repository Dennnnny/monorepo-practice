## Development server

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.

# FEATURE

npx nx g @nrwl/react:application
npx nx g @nrwl/react:component
npx nx g @nrwl/react:lib / library

npx nx g @nrwl/workspace:lib

--directiory=XXX
--dry-run

# ISSUE

### run test

```
  ➜ web git:(main) ✗ npx nx test cart

  > nx run cart:test

  > NX Only file and data URLs are supported by the default ESM loader
  > Pass --verbose to see the stacktrace.
```

turns out: node version is too low
use 16.15.0, works

### dry-run

Cannot install required package @nrwl/jest during a dry run. Run the generator without --dryRun, or install the package with "npm install -D @nrwl/jest@15.4.5" and try again.

I think it's because I have no package @nrwl/jest,
if I did, I should be able to run dry-run
